# 2SP_RiskChance
In this paper, we study optimal procurement and inventory decisions for a supply chain with a single perishable product  under demand uncertainty. To control risk, on the one hand, we use a risk-averse objective, and on the other hand, we  utilize a chance constraint to satisfy demand with a high probability.
